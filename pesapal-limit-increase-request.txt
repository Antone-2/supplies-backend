Subject: Request to Increase Transaction Limits for Production Merchant Account - Medhelm Supplies

Dear PesaPal Support Team,

I am writing to request an increase in transaction limits for my production merchant account.

**Account Details:**
- Business Name: Medhelm Supplies
- Business Type: Medical Supplies E-commerce Platform
- Website: medhelmsupplies.co.ke
- Current Status: Production account active with authentication working

**Current Issue:**
Transactions above 1,000 KES are being rejected with the error "amount_exceeds_default_limit". This is significantly limiting our business operations.

**Requested Limits:**
- **Per Transaction Limit**: 2,000,000 KES
- **Daily Transaction Limit**: 10,000,000 KES (to accommodate multiple large institutional orders)
- **Monthly Limit**: 100,000,000 KES (medical supplies business volume)

**Business Justification:**
Our medical supplies business serves:
- Major hospitals and medical centers requiring complete equipment setups
- Government healthcare institutions with large procurement needs
- Private clinics and specialized medical facilities
- Emergency response organizations requiring urgent bulk supplies
- Medical research institutions with high-value equipment needs
- International NGOs operating healthcare programs in Kenya

**Typical Transaction Amounts:**
- Small orders: 5,000 - 50,000 KES (medical consumables, basic devices)
- Medium orders: 50,000 - 200,000 KES (medical equipment, diagnostic tools)
- Large orders: 200,000 - 1,000,000 KES (hospital equipment, surgical sets, bulk supplies)
- Institutional orders: 1,000,000 - 2,000,000 KES (complete medical facility setups, emergency procurement)

**Business Volume Expectations:**
- Average monthly transactions: 300-800 orders
- Average order value: 125,000 KES
- Large institutional clients: 20-50 orders per month (500K-2M KES each)
- Peak periods: Higher volumes during medical equipment procurement seasons and emergency response situations
- Target annual revenue: 500M - 1B KES through the platform

**Additional Information:**
- We have completed PesaPal integration testing successfully
- Our technical implementation is production-ready
- We are prepared to provide any additional business documentation required
- KRA PIN and business registration documents available upon request

We kindly request expedited processing of this limit increase as we have customers waiting to complete their medical supply purchases.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please let me know if you need any additional information or documentation.

Best regards,

Medhelm Supplies Team
